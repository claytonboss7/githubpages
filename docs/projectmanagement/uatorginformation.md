## Details
### Purpose
The sandbox ```PreProd``` has been designated as the org where we will store accepted release items as we plan an initial release.  UAT (User Acceptance Testing) is the function of this Org, and is our process to get confirmation that a feature works as intended on a happy path for users.. with testing performed by the stake holder.  The username of the sandbox would be your Production username with ```.preprod``` appended to the end, logged into from https://test.salesforce.com
For information on sandboxes overall, see this link.  

### Type
The ```PreProd``` sandbox is a DEVELOPER PRO sandbox.
