        <p>
            To protect your privacy and ensure your security, we will also take reasonable measures to verify your identity before allowing you to access, correct, change, or delete your personal 
            information. Any request may therefore need to be accompanied by a copy of your identity card. We will strive to respond to your requests within the time limits required by the “GDPR”. 
            If you are unhappy with the way we are using your Personal Data you can also contact and are free to lodge a claim with your local Data Protection Authority.
        </p>
        <h2>6. Opting Out of Use of Certain Information That May be Collected by Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p>
            When you visit our Sites, use our Services, or visit a third-party website for which we provide online services, we and our business partners and vendors may use Tracking Technologies to 
            recognize you as a repeat visitor and to customize your online experiences, the Services you use, and other online content and advertising, measure the effectiveness of promotions and 
            perform analytics, and to mitigate risk, prevent potential fraud, and promote trust and safety across the Sites and the Services. Certain aspects and features of our Services and Sites 
            are only available through the use of Tracking Technologies, so if you choose to disable or decline Tracking Technologies, your use of the Sites and Services may be limited or not possible. 
            Please review our Cookie Policy here to learn more about how we use and how you may adjust and disable Tracking Technologies.
        </p>
        <h2>7. Personal Data retention and deletion</h2>
        <p>
            We keep your Personal Data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Services and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining the performance of the Service, 
            making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes. We keep some of your Personal Data for as long as you 
            are a user of the Services.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your data used for marketing activities are preserved until you request they be limited or deleted, and after a limit of three years from the time of their collection by Road Rebel Global 
            or of the last contact entered into with Road Rebel Global. At the end of this period, the data will be destroyed in accordance with the measures prescribed by the legislation in force.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data making it possible to trace the collection of your consent are stored by Road Rebel Global for a maximum period of 5 years in order to, if necessary, provide evidence of your consent.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some Personal Data may be kept for a longer period of time for the management of claims and/or litigation and to meet our legal and regulatory obligations, or to respond to requests from 
            competent authorities. If you request, we will delete or anonymize your Personal Data so that it no longer identifies you, unless, we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain 
            Personal Data, including situations such as the following:
        </p>
        <ul class="slds-list_dotted">
            <li>
                <p>
                    Where we are required to retain the Personal Data for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain the necessary Personal Data for the period required by 
                    applicable law; and/or;
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our user.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>8. Data Security and Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>
            We have put in place organizational and technical security measures to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of your Personal Data. These include administrative, organizational, 
            technical and physical precautions designed to protect your Personal Data from loss, theft, unauthorized access, unauthorized transmission, modification, or destruction. In all cases, 
            Road Rebel Global will take security measures appropriate to the nature of the data collected.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, despite these efforts, Road Rebel Global cannot guarantee the infallibility of this protection because risks may inevitably arise during the transmission of personal data. No 
            method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure – so we cannot guarantee its absolute security. You should take certain steps 
            to protect your account and Personal Data as well, such as by choosing a strong password and keeping such password private and logging out of your account when you are finished using it. 
            We are not responsible for protecting any Personal Data that we share with a third-party based on an account connection that you have authorized. Road Rebel Global will not be responsible 
            for any actual or consequential damages that result from a lapse in compliance with this Privacy Policy because of a technical malfunction or a breach in security.
        </p>
        <h2>9. Transfer of your Personal Data in a country located outside the European Union</h2>
        <p>
            Under the GDPR, Data transfer is understood to mean “any communication, copy, or movement of Personal Data intended to be processed in a third country, or any data which a third party 
            outside the European Union can access”. You are informed that your Personal Data are transferred to Road Rebel Global and its affiliates located in the United States so outside the 
            European Union.
        </p>
        <p>
            Road Rebel Global may also subcontract processing to, or share your Personal Data with, third parties located in countries other than your home country. Your Personal Data, therefore, 
            may be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country of residence. Personal Data collected within the European Union and Switzerland may, for example, be 
            transferred to and processed by third parties located in a country outside of the European Union.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the event your Personal Data are transferred to third parties located outside the European Union, Road Rebel Global guarantees:
        </p>
        <ul class="slds-list_dotted">
            <li><p>To have collected all necessary authorizations from the competent authority to carry out said transfer,</p></li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    That, whether the transfer is governed by the standard contractual clauses of the European Commission, by internal corporate rules (Binding Corporate Rules), or by ad hoc 
                    contractual clauses which the local Data Protection Authority has previously recognized, the rules guarantee a sufficient level of protection of the privacy and fundamental 
                    rights of individuals.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you wish to gain more information about such transfers, please contact: Road Rebel Global office at <a href="tel:+1(619)640-1001">+1 (619) 640-1001</a></p>
        <h2>10. Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
        <p>
            From time to time, we may modify this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives, third party requirements or changes in the law, technology, our information collection and use 
            practices or the features and functionality of the Services, and such modifications shall be effective upon posting. If we materially change our Privacy Policy, we will notify you of 
            such changes by posting them on Road Rebel Global or by sending you an email or other notification. Your continued use of the Services after we post a revised Privacy Policy (and,

            Data making it possible to trace the collection of your consent are stored by Road Rebel Global for a maximum period of 5 years in order to, if necessary, provide evidence of your consent.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some Personal Data may be kept for a longer period of time for the management of claims and/or litigation and to meet our legal and regulatory obligations, or to respond to requests from 
            competent authorities. If you request, we will delete or anonymize your Personal Data so that it no longer identifies you, unless, we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain 
            Personal Data, including situations such as the following:
        </p>
        <ul class="slds-list_dotted">
            <li>
                <p>
                    Where we are required to retain the Personal Data for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain the necessary Personal Data for the period required by 
                    applicable law; and/or;
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our user.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>8. Data Security and Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>
            We have put in place organizational and technical security measures to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of your Personal Data. These include administrative, organizational, 
            technical and physical precautions designed to protect your Personal Data from loss, theft, unauthorized access, unauthorized transmission, modification, or destruction. In all cases, 
            Road Rebel Global will take security measures appropriate to the nature of the data collected.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, despite these efforts, Road Rebel Global cannot guarantee the infallibility of this protection because risks may inevitably arise during the transmission of personal data. No 
            method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure – so we cannot guarantee its absolute security. You should take certain steps 
            to protect your account and Personal Data as well, such as by choosing a strong password and keeping such password private and logging out of your account when you are finished using it. 
            We are not responsible for protecting any Personal Data that we share with a third-party based on an account connection that you have authorized. Road Rebel Global will not be responsible 
            for any actual or consequential damages that result from a lapse in compliance with this Privacy Policy because of a technical malfunction or a breach in security.
        </p>
        <h2>9. Transfer of your Personal Data in a country located outside the European Union</h2>
        <p>
            Under the GDPR, Data transfer is understood to mean “any communication, copy, or movement of Personal Data intended to be processed in a third country, or any data which a third party 
            outside the European Union can access”. You are informed that your Personal Data are transferred to Road Rebel Global and its affiliates located in the United States so outside the 
            European Union.
        </p>
        <p>
            Road Rebel Global may also subcontract processing to, or share your Personal Data with, third parties located in countries other than your home country. Your Personal Data, therefore, 
            may be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country of residence. Personal Data collected within the European Union and Switzerland may, for example, be 
            transferred to and processed by third parties located in a country outside of the European Union.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the event your Personal Data are transferred to third parties located outside the European Union, Road Rebel Global guarantees:
        </p>
        <ul class="slds-list_dotted">
            <li><p>To have collected all necessary authorizations from the competent authority to carry out said transfer,</p></li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    That, whether the transfer is governed by the standard contractual clauses of the European Commission, by internal corporate rules (Binding Corporate Rules), or by ad hoc 
                    contractual clauses which the local Data Protection Authority has previously recognized, the rules guarantee a sufficient level of protection of the privacy and fundamental 
                    rights of individuals.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you wish to gain more information about such transfers, please contact: Road Rebel Global office at <a href="tel:+1(619)640-1001">+1 (619) 640-1001</a></p>
        <h2>10. Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
        <p>
            From time to time, we may modify this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives, third party requirements or changes in the law, technology, our information collection and use 
            practices or the features and functionality of the Services, and such modifications shall be effective upon posting. If we materially change our Privacy Policy, we will notify you of 
            such changes by posting them on Road Rebel Global or by sending you an email or other notification. Your continued use of the Services after we post a revised Privacy Policy (and, 
            where appropriate, notify you of same) signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. It is therefore important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you 
            are updated as to any changes. We may continue to process your Personal Data based on our legitimate interests or in order to fulfill our obligations under a contract and/or may also 
            seek your affirmative consent to the terms of the updated Privacy Policy. For example, we may ask for your consent before implementing new uses of the Personal Data that we have already 
            collected from you based on such consent, if such new use was not addressed by the privacy policy under which such information was collected or if our legal basis for processing such 
            information changes.
        </p>
        <h2>11. Accuracy</h2>
        <p>
            It is your responsibility to give us current, complete, truthful and accurate information, including Personal Data, and to keep such information up to date. We cannot and will not be 
            responsible for any problems or liability that may arise if you do not give us accurate, truthful or complete Information or you fail to update such Information. We may reject or delete 
            any Information or entry for any reason, including if we believe in good faith that the Information is false, fraudulent or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use.
        </p>
        <h2>12. Your California Privacy Rights under CCPA</h2>
        <p>
            If you are a resident of the State of California, we provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options such as your right to opt-out (which we may sometimes 
            refer to as “unsubscribe”) with respect to use of your Personal Data by third parties for marketing purposes, your right of Access (the right to be informed of and request access to the 
            Personal Data we process about you), your right to Erasure (the right to request that we delete your Personal Data). In order to enable you to exercise these rights, you can fill out our 
            form Privacy Request.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pursuant to the California Civil Code and the CCPA, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Data for marketing purposes during 
            the preceding year. If you are a California resident and wish to request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, please send a request by filling out our 
            form Privacy Request. All requests must be labeled “Your California Privacy Rights” on the form. For all requests, please clearly state that the request is related to “Your California 
            Privacy Rights”, include your name, street address, city, state, zip code and e-mail address (your street address is optional if you wish to receive a response to your request via email) 
            and indicate your preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). We will not accept requests via the telephone, postal mail or by fax. We are not 
            responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.
