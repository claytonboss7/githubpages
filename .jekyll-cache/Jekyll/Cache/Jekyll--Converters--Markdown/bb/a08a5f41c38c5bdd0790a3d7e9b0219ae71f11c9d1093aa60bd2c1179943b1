<p>Users can log into the sandbox at https://roadrebel–rrdev.my.salesforce.com by appending .sandbox_name to their Salesforce usernames. For example, if a username for a production organization is user1@acme.com, and the sandbox is named “test”, then the modified username to log into the sandbox is user1@acme.com.test.</p>

<p>For the QA sandbox for example my username would be admin@rr.com.rrdev
The password for this will be whatever your ccdev password was.</p>

<p>This sandbox will be refreshed after every deployment and has been setup to automatically pull the data it needs to work, like Conga, Community users, etc.
