# Quality Assurance

The categories for QA focused on in the Voyajer system are:
## QA/Exception Reports
These reports will only email us when they return data,  and allow meaningful mails to alert us to problems.  They are normal reports which can be viewed on demand but also will run on a schedule to have some type of automated checks in place.
  * [View Options Details](exception-reports/view-options)
    * Verify logic related to showing options in the Client Community
  * [Has Duplicate Traces](exception-reports/has-duplicate-traces)
    * Scheduled report to catch duplicate trace situations
