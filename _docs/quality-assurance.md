# Quality Assurance

The categories for QA focused on in the Voyajer system are:
## [Exception Reports](quality-assurance/exception-reports)

These reports will only email us when they return data,  and allow meaningful mails to alert us to problems.  They are normal reports which can be viewed on demand but also will run on a schedule to have some type of automated checks in place.  
## Automated Tests
Tests written in the code required by SF to cover 75% of code.
