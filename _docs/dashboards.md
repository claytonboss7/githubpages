# Dashboards

There are 4 similar dashboards for all of the services that get serviced.   Housing is the focus at the time of writing and the GT, Freight, and Air ones are similar with their own little nuances.  These details will try and give a user overview as well as a training for the business logic that lives in the code,  as it will be laid out in the details on the page.  This can hopefully be a reference to anyone who has to reference parts of the workflow whether it is for a new hire or internally to spread the knowledge.

Housing would have some key details on the setup of the Housing Objects and the Production, and how default preferred Room Types are stored and related to everything properly.  From a user perspective, the Housing Dashboard is where Coordinators will work Productions that are Active and the Coordinators will facilitate everything that goes into booking their travel.  The process starts with some key objects:
