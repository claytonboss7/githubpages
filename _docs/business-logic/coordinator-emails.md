## Coordinator Email Logic

The Coordinator emails refer to the outbound emails generated by the system for Workflow events like sending Bids, sending Options, and any emails out to the client.  These emails are client-facing and require the RR Coordinator who the communication is coming from to be correct and conditional based on if a back end coordinator is set.

When the emails are sent out to the client we have the ability to set the following data points which will be driven by the type of Email:
* Sender Name
* Sender Address*
* Reply-To

The User record in the Production Association will be used to decide which values we will set,  and we do a conditional check of which Email it is, and who should be used.  

### Google Sheet - Coordinator Emails

The data below contains the Email Type, the Role that should be used, and a reference if the Backend Coordinator has been set how to handle it.  Most fall into the rule of "If a Backend exists, use it" except for the ones highlighted in the table.  Those specific emails will use the Primary regardless if the backend is set.
