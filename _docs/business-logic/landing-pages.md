## Landing Pages for Bid and Closeouts

Overview
To Submit Bids and Submit Pick Up reports without needing to authenticate into the community, Force.com Sites are setup for vendor Bid Submissoins and the Pick Up reports.  They are sent links to the respective landing pages and the Bid has an Id generated for the landing page as an identifier.   The style is consistent with the Voyajer Aura Components that existed for the Community.  The processes both involve the key processes that impact Bid, Housing (Room Types and Stays), Revenue (Commission + Revenue Types).
