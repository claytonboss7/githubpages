# Troubleshooting Landing Pages

## Reports
### [UUIDs for Bids](https://roadrebel.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Report/00O3w0000052BBOEA2/view?queryScope=userFolders)
View the Bids that were modified Today, and their associated Landing Page URLs.  These URLs are in the Bid Request Email and the Pickup Report email, and this report would be for reference purposes only.  There is no expectations that users would use this report, only Admins.

### [Force.com Site Usage Reports](https://roadrebel.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Folder/00l3w000002ODcoAAG/view?queryScope=userFolders)
Force.com Sites have limits like bandwidth, time spent processing, etc.  The reports in the folder linked give access to show the metrics and if we are in danger of coming close to any of the threshholds.  Once we have daily traffic to the Sites it will be important to catch anything in danger of stopping serving the Page, and we can set up alerts to track this.
