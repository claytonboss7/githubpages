**Figure out how you will motivate employees to skill up. Below are a few methods that Salesforce and many of our customers have used to drive Trailhead engagement.**

* A fun Trailhead Challenge is a very effective way to kick off your initial Trailhead engagement, ie) reward your top badge earners after a 6-week Trailhead learning adventure! 
    * We’ve also seen successful challenges that last 3 months, 6 months, 12 months. It’s up to you! 
* Rank Challenge - Identify a [rank](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/trailblazer-ranks)for your learners to achieve or challenge them to level up to higher rank(s).
* Promotion Criteria - Employees must complete specific Trails, Modules, etc. or achieve a certain [Trailhead rank](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/trailblazer-ranks)in order to be considered for promotion. 
* Completion of a specific Trail, Module, or Trailmix prior to an event

**Define the details of your own Trailhead Challenge to kick off your organization's learning adventure** 

* Who can earn the most Trailhead badges in 6 weeks? Six weeks is the perfect amount of time to allow for participants to thoroughly engage with the content and still focus on their core job.
    * Define the timeframe that works best for your organization. We’ve also seen Challenges last 3, 6, 12 months. It’s up to you! 
* Who can earn the [Trailhead Ranger Rank](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/trailblazer-ranks) by a certain date?(Allow at least 3 months)

* Emphasize that the focus should be on *learning*, not merely badge collecting. Winners will be determined by points *_and_* badges to help validate this. 

* Identify a prize or incentive for your Trailhead Challenge. Some ideas below:
    * Emphasize that **the real prize is the learning**, new skills, and professional development.
    * **Recognition**, such as a “Trailblazer Spotlight” and/or opportunity to present their key Trailhead learnings to Leadership
    * **Swag**, such as a [Trailblazer Hoodie](https://trailheadstore.com/), Bose Headphones, Gift Cards, etc. 
    * Donation to charity of choice
