## QA Sandbox Info for rrdev

Users can log into the sandbox at https://roadrebel--rrdev.my.salesforce.com by appending .sandbox_name to their Salesforce usernames. For example, if a username for a production organization is user1@acme.com, and the sandbox is named “test”, then the modified username to log into the sandbox is user1@acme.com.test.

For the QA sandbox for example my username would be admin@rr.com.rrdev
The password for this will be whatever your ccdev password was.

This sandbox will be refreshed after every deployment and has been setup to automatically pull the data it needs to work, like Conga, Community users, etc.
