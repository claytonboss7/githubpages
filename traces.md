## Trace Statuses

The statuses for Housing on the Front End (Status_CC**c options) each have a task assigned to them if set with a trace date. In siutuations where a Front End Coordinator (Primary Housing Coordinator) and Backend Coordinator (Back_End_Coordinator**c) are set, only certain statuses should be assigned to the backend coordinator to handle. The sheet below lists each status and if it should be reassigned when the Back end Coordinator is set. It also will assign back to Primary Housing Coordinator if the backend is removed.
