# Introduction

 ## Who? 
 **Road Rebel** facilitates travel and hotels for Entertainment Productions by having a marketplace for **Vendors** to bid on things available that the **Customers** would have selected from the options RR Provided them.  They use SF Communities for a Vendor and Client experience, and SF internal users will use dashboards created with custom code.
 ## What?
 The Salesforce Platform for Road Rebel, also known as **Voyajer**, is the Community and Sales Cloud solution that runs some of the core processes for Road Rebel and faciliating their client travelers.
  The system utilizes a **Community** (or "Experience") with Partner Plus Community Licenses as well as Sales Cloud licenses for internal Coordinators.

## Where?
Voyajer is a Cloud solution that current only requires a web browser with an internet connection.

## When?
The system will be evolving over the next year, but in the interim all information and logic in this wiki should be relevant and maintained.

## Why?
We are in the infnacy of what is sure to be a large complicated solution crossing multiple platforms.  This is supposed to prevent tribal knowledge, hesitancy to ask questions, and overall empower the team to be able to have a place to find answers.  One of the biggest problems with Documentation is maintanence and a central repository for the documents.  This serves that purpose.
